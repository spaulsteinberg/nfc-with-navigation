# Restaurant Management System Mobile App

This is the mobile prototype for a patent pending (US 18/171,335).

## Overview

Restaurant reservation companies such as OpenTable, Resy, and Yelp have taken strides to be more than just reservation companies through giving more control to the restaurants themselves.
Users (restaurants) can use the reservation system, wait time calculators, and availability to make smarter decisions on where to sit walk-ins, what estimate to give waiting customers, and even get analytics on where they might improve.
This project focuses on the latter, employee productivity, as well as increasing turntable optimization. By taking advantage of NFC technology and internet-connected mobile devices that are increasingly commonplace, 
we can help to bring analytics to real-time, track who is doing what work, and also get tables cleaned and ready for the next customer more efficiently.
